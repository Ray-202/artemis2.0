Areas of higher elevation (positive values) may imply more energy cost for uphill traversal, and potentially more exposure or shadowing depending on terrain geometry.
	â€¢	Areas of lower elevation (negative values) might be crater floors or basins, which may pose different hazards (e.g., steep walls to climb out of) even if slope is moderate.
